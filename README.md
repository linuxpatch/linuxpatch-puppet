# Puppet Module: Install LinuxPatch.com agent

## Description

This Puppet module automates the process of downloading, executing an installation script from [linuxpatch.com](https://linuxpatch.com). The module downloads the `install.sh` script to the `/tmp` directory, runs it with the provided `LP_KEY` as an environment variable, and then removes the script from the system. The script is only executed if the file `/opt/linuxpatch/bin/linuxpatch` does not exist. Additionally, the module ensures that the `linuxpatch-agent` service is running and enabled on startup.
